## Guidelines

### About Cards

The card component is a stylized container with padding and margin options (more information in the <Anchor href="#padding-and-margins"> example below</Anchor>). It is a flexible component that can be customized to fit a variety of use cases.
Cards do not handle interactive events but can have children with event handlers, such as a button or an anchor.

### Accessibility

Here are some quick accessibility tips to ensure a positive user experience for all users:

- Add links or buttons in the card instead of making the whole card clickable
- Use the visually hidden component to describe the purpose of the card when the purpose is not evident from the content on the card

---

## Composition

Use the card component to group similar information. Keep the card simple so that users can focus on the content and the desired action.
Cards can grab a users attention so make sure that the information on the card can be read and understood independently.

## Examples

<ThemeSwitcher />

### Primary

The primary card is the most common variation and can be used on any light background.

```jsx live
<Card padding="scale100">Wombats have backwards-facing pouches</Card>
```

### Inverse

The inverse cards uses the inverse shadow and is designed to be used on dark backgrounds.

```jsx live bg=darkest
<Card variant="inverse" padding="scale100">
  A group of wombats is known as a wisdom
</Card>
```

### Border

The border variation does not have a shadow but has a border. While it exists for all themes it is intended for use on the Ahoy theme.

```jsx live
<Card variant="border" padding="scale100">
  A wombat's main line of defense is their toughened posterior
</Card>
```

### Padding and Margins

The padding and margin for the card can be customized using the padding and margin props. The order of these props matters! The order of the props in the component
corresponds to the order the CSS properties are added. For instance, having paddingLeft **after** padding ensures that the left padding comes from the paddingLeft property.

```jsx live
<Card padding="scale100" paddingLeft="scale540" margin="scale100">
  <p>There are three sub-species of wombats</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bare-Nosed Wombat</li>
    <li>Southern Hairy-nosed</li>
    <li>Northern Hairy Nosed</li>
  </ul>
</Card>
```

However, if paddingLeft is first the left padding will come from the padding property.

```jsx live
<Card paddingLeft="scale540" padding="scale100" margin="scale100">
  <p>There are three sub-species of wombats</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bare-Nosed Wombat</li>
    <li>Southern Hairy-nosed</li>
    <li>Northern Hairy Nosed</li>
  </ul>
</Card>
```
