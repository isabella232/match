ðŸ‘‹ Hi Twilio developer. Follow the steps below to begin building with Match

## 1. Install external dependencies

| Package           | Version |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| react             | 16.x    |
| react-dom         | 16.x    |
| react-is          | 16.x    |
| prop-types        | 16.x    |
| styled-components | 5.x     |

### Install dependencies using yarn

```shell
yarn add react react-dom prop-types react-is styled-components
```

## 2. Configure GitHub Package Registry

The Match packages are hosted on the GitHub Package Registry and require some additional configuration to install.

For Yarn 2 and up, add the following to the .yarnrc.yml file in the root of your project:

```yaml
npmScopes:
  twilio-labs:
    npmRegistryServer: "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
```

For Yarn 1, add the following to the .yarnrc file in the root of your project.

```
"@twilio-labs:registry" "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
```

For NPM, add the following to the .npmrc file in the root of your project.

```
@twilio-labs:regsitry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## 3. Install Match packages
