## Guidelines

### About Card List

The Card List block can be placed anywhere on the page below the hero. There should be 3 cards that introduce the user to 3 different examples. Each card should use a different circle icon that relates to the example on the card. All of the icons should be the same color and the color should match the color of the section heading. There is a list of valid colors and instructions on changing the color on the [How to Use Blocks](./how-to-use-blocks.mdx) page.
