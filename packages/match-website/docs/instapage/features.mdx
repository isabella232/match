## Guidelines

## About Features

The features block can appear anywhere under the hero. This specific features block should be used when a description is desired for each feature. There is a features block with 6 features and features block with 9 features. A single feature can be deleted from the end of each of these blocks to make it 5 features or 8 features. Do not delete more than one feature and do not add additional features.

The icon at the top of the block should have a rounded background and the color of the icon should correspond to the section header color. There is a list of valid colors and instructions on changing the color on the [How to Use Blocks](./how-to-use-blocks.mdx) page.
