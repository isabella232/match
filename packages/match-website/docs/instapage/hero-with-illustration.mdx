## Guidelines

### About Hero with Illustration

The Hero block should be the first block on a page. The message the hero conveys needs to be put across simply and concisely to convey the product or service effectively. Each Hero section should contain a primary CTA that directs users to complete a desired action or to visit key content. This specific hero block includes an illustration that should be colorful and energetic, furthering the brand personality and representing the content of the page. All illustrations should be approved by brand.
