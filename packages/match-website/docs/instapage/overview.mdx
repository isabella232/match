## Guidelines

### About Overview

The overview block can be placed anywhere on a page and is used to provide further details to a user. The icon at the top of the block should have a rounded background and the color of the icon should correspond to the section header color. There is a list of valid colors and instructions on changing the color on the [How to Use Blocks](./how-to-use-blocks.mdx) page.
