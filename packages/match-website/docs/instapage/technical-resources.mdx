## Guidelines

### About Technical Resources

The technical resources block is typically towards the top of a page and targets technical users. It should link out to docs or code examples that are relevant to the page. The block should always have 2 cards. The language bar should not change.

The icon at the top of the block should have a rounded background and the color of the icon should correspond to the section header color. There is a list of valid colors and instructions on changing the color on the [How to Use Blocks](./how-to-use-blocks.mdx) page.
