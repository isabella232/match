Icons are visual symbols and indicators that support an action or function in an user interface. They can also be used to enhance or represent content.

## Guidelines

### About Icons

Informative icons may be used to clarify actions a user may take or draw attention to specific UI elements. Decorative icons do not add information to the page and are included for visual enhancements only.

### Accessibility

Here are some quick accessibility tips to ensure a positive user experience for all users:

- Always include a title for icons that are not purely decorative.
- Titles should provide additional context to the icon rather than describe the image.
- Pair icons with descriptive text whenever possible.
- Icons should not be interactive. They may be used within an interactive components, such as the Button.

## Examples

### Icon Color

The default icon color may be altered using a [color token](../design-tokens/tokens.mdx#colors).

```jsx live
<ChatIcon decorative color="basePurple" />
```

### Icon Size

The size may be adjusted with an [icon size token](../design-tokens/tokens.mdx#icon-sizes).

```jsx live
<>
  <ChatIcon decorative size="small" />
  <br />
  <ChatIcon decorative size="medium" />
  <br />
  <ChatIcon decorative size="base" />
  <br />
  <ChatIcon decorative size="large" />
  <br />
  <ChatIcon decorative size="xLarge" />
</>
```

Icon size accepts [responsive values](https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles#responsive-styles).

```jsx live
<ChatIcon decorative size={["large", "medium"]} />
```

### Decorative Icons

Titles are required for accessibility compliance unless the icon is specifically designated as decorative.

```jsx live
<>
  <ChatIcon title="Talk to me!" />
  <br />
  <ChatIcon decorative />
</>
```
