## Guidelines

### About Inputs

Inputs are interactive form controls that accept a single line of text from a user. By default, inputs accept any combination of letters number and symbols. They can be given constraints by setting the `type` attribute to one of number, tel, url, or email. Inputs with specific types may also provide customized keyboard layouts in browsers and devices that support dynamic keyboards.

### Accessibility

Here are some quick accessibility tips to ensure a positive user experience for all users.

- Always include a descriptive label for each Input.
- Do not use placeholder text as a replacement for labels.
- Use the most appropriate input type for the data requested (e.g. text, email, or url).
- Use `helper` to provide information on how to pass the Input's validation.
- Use `error` to provide information on how to correct invalid data.

## Composition

All Inputs must include a label. A label may be visually hidden only if the purpose of the Input is abundantly apparent. The `hideLabel` prop will remove the label entirely and apply an `aria-label` to the input element for screen readers.

Labels should be short and descriptive with any instructional text belonging in `helper`. Keep supplemental helper text concise and relevant to the input's validation requirements.

When an Input contains invalid data, provide an `error` message with instructional cues on how to make the correction. Any `helper` text provided with the Input will be replaced by the `error`. Be sure to repeat any relevant information that would have been lost.

<VirtueCrime>
  <Virtue>
    Only use placeholder text when clarifying examples are required. Try not to
    overuse it as it can cause clutter and confusion for a user.
  </Virtue>
  <Crime>Don't use placeholder text for every field.</Crime>
  <Virtue>
    Use help text to provide additional information to the user that could help
    prevent errors.
  </Virtue>
  <Crime>
    Don't use placeholder text to provide error preventing information.
  </Crime>
  <Virtue>
    Use disabled to show a user that an input can not be interacted with yet.
  </Virtue>
  <Crime>
    Don't use disabled to show information in an input that can not be edited.
  </Crime>
</VirtueCrime>

## Examples

<ThemeSwitcher />

### Input with Help Text

Labels and help text are controlled via the Input component props in order to ensure consistency and accessibility best practices.

```jsx live
<Input
  type="email"
  name="email"
  label="Email Address"
  placeholder="(e.g. example@twilio.com)"
  helper="Please enter a valid email."
  required
/>
```

### Input with Error

Providing any error message will mark the field as invalid. Note that `helper` text is replaced by `error` text.

```jsx live
<Input
  type="email"
  name="email"
  label="Email Address"
  defaultValue="@twilio.com"
  helper="Please enter a valid email."
  error="Email is invalid."
  required
/>
```

### Disabled Input

Disabled form fields cannot be interacted with. Use a read-only field for showing static information which cannot be edited.

```jsx live
<Input type="email" name="email" label="Email Address" disabled />
```

### Read-only Input

Read-only inputs can be focused but cannot be edited. Use a read-only Input when a user should be able to select and copy the text within. An example of when to use a read-only input may be displaying a user's responses after a form has been submitted.

```jsx live
<Input
  type="email"
  name="email"
  label="Email Address"
  defaultValue="example@twilio.com"
  readOnly
/>
```
