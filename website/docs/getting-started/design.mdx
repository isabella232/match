ðŸ‘‹ Hi Twilio designer! To begin using Match make sure that you have access to
Figma and Dropbox, then follow the steps below. If you need access to either of these reach out to the Slack channel **#help-match-dsys**.

When you are all set up be
sure to check out the rest of this site to learn about different components
and best practices for using them!

:::note
Figma files may include some components not yet available in Match. Make
sure components you design with will be released before your team starts
building. Check out the roadmap to learn more!

## Using the Figma Libraries

To begin using a Match Figma Library, select "Libraries" from the menu in your desired project. Use the toggle to turn on/off any desired libraries.
We recommend turning on all the libraries (tokens, icons, and components) that exist for your theme.

Once you've enabled the libraries you can add components in the "Assets" panel. Tokens can be added using the menus on the right side of the UI.
For more specific information on adding components, tokens, and icons reference the corresponding Match project. If you run into any issues or have questions don't hesitate to come to reach our to us on slack!
