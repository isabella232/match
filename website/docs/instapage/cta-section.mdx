### About CTA Section

The CTA Section is typically the final block on a page. It will always include a Primary CTA, but the secondary CTA is optional. In Instapage there is a block with both the Primary CTA and the Secondary CTA and a block that only has a primary CTA. Both the primary and secondary CTA (if included) should start with a verb and should indicate where the user will be taken if they click on that CTA.
