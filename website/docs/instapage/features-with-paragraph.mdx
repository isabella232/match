## Guidelines

### About Features with Paragraph

The Features with a Paragraph block can appear anywhere under the hero. There is a block for 4 features, 6 features and 8 features. No additional features should be added or taken away. This specific features block should be used when specific features do not need a description but there is additional information about the feature set.

The icon at the top of the block should have a rounded background and the color of the icon should correspond to the section header color. There is a list of valid colors and instructions on changing the color on the [How to Use Blocks](./how-to-use-blocks.mdx) page.
