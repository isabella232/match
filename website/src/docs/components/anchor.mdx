## Guidelines

### Anchors vs Buttons

All actions outside of linking to another URL should use a button. For example, actions such as submitting a form or closing a module should
use a Button.

If an Anchor does not link to a valid URL, omit the `href` attribute to render as a button. Never set `href` to "#" or "javascript:void(0)".

The Button component can also be used as a CTA anchor when the href prop is included. In this situation the element looks like a button but
renders as an anchor.

Learn more about the [Button component](/docs/components/button) to determine if it will fit your needs better.

### Accessibility

Here are some quick accessibility tips to ensure a positive user experience for all users:

- Avoid using only color to communicate information. Use another indicator, such as an underline.
- Screen Reader users may choose to navigate by links instead of reading the full page, so anchor text needs to make sense without the surrounding
  sentences or content. When this is not possible use the [visually hidden component](/docs/components/visually-hidden) to supply additional information to users.

**Note**: The title attribute was not included because it is not exposed by all browsers in an accessible way, meaning that users navigating
with assistive technology may never see that information.

## Composition

Anchors inherit font size and alignment from their parent container.

Make sure to always include a valid href and anchor text that conveys the function, purpose, or destination of the anchor. Avoid ambiguous anchor
text, such as ‘click here’ or ‘more’. When possible avoid using the same anchor text for anchors that take users to different content.

## Examples

### Primary

The primary link is the most common variation and can be used on any light background.

```jsx live
<Anchor href="/docs/components/button">Learn when to use a button</Anchor>
```

### Inverse

Inverse anchors are designed to be accessible on dark backgrounds.

**Note:** Inverse anchors are not accessible on SendGrid Blue backgrounds, use a [button](/docs/components/button) instead.

```jsx live bg=darkest
<Anchor variant="inverse" href="/docs/design-tokens/tokens">
  Design Tokens
</Anchor>
```

### Text

Text anchors inherit their parent's color for the default state. This variation should be used sparingly and should be used in instances
where it is obvious that it is a hyperlink, such as a reference in a list of references.

```jsx live
<Anchor
  variant="text"
  href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/introducing-trust-hub-now-in-beta"
>
  Introducing Trust Hub - Now in Beta
</Anchor>
```

### External Link

If an external anchor is used for the href prop, the target and rel will automatically be set for security purposes.

`target = "\_blank"`

`rel = "noreferrer noopener"`

```jsx live
<Anchor href="https://twilio.com/flex">Twilio Flex</Anchor>
```

However, the target and rel property can be overridden using the target and rel props

```jsx live
<Anchor href="https://twilio.com/messaging" target="_self" rel="noopener">
  Twilio Messaging
</Anchor>
```

### Primary, No Underline

Every anchor variation has an option to get rid of the underline. Anchors without an underline should only be used when it is obvious
that the text is an anchor. Consider using an icon as an additional indicator that the text is an anchor for anchors without an underline.

```jsx live
<p>
  Sources:
  <Anchor href="https://sendgrid.com" noUnderline>
    sendgrid.com
  </Anchor>, <Anchor href="https://twilio.com" noUnderline>
    twilio.com
  </Anchor>
</p>
```

### Icon

Anchors may include an icon from one of the [Match icon libraries](/docs/components/icon). Always place icons to the right of the link text.

```jsx live
<Anchor href="https://sendgrid.com">
  Send with confidence
  <OutboundIcon decorative />
</Anchor>
```
