## Guidelines

### About Grids and Cells

The grid component helps position and align content, creating a consistent layout. A grid can be used on the page overall, within page sections,
and within components. Grids are responsive and will resize as the browser width changes. Additionally, the grid component can be used to adjust
the layout as the browser width changes.

### Accessibility

- The cells should be in a logical order based upon content. Ensure that the semantic order of content remains logical if the visual order of content is
  changed. Additionally, ensure that the keyboard tab order of cells remains consistent with the visual order of cells.
- Do not get rid of semantic elements to create a simpler layout. For example, do not get rid of ul to use li as cells.
  Semantic elements are critical for screen reader users

## Composition

### Design

There is a grid for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Each of these grids can be added to any frame using the "layout grid" in the right hand menus.

### Development

The grid and cell components use [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) as a means for exposing customizable css as components props.
The exposed props follow [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) allowing for a comprehensive coverage for a variety of layout use cases.

## Examples

### Responsive

The grid component can be used to make a responsive layout. Any prop can use the notation [value, value, value] and the first value would correspond to mobile,
the second value, would correspond to tablet, and the third value would correspond to desktop.

The example below aligns four rectangles based on the browser width. Desktop has 4 rectangles across in a single row with 48px gaps. Tablet has 2 rows with
2 rectangles across and 32px gaps. Mobile has 4 rows, each with a single rectangle and 16px gaps.

```jsx live
<Grid
  gridTemplateColumns={[null, "1fr", "repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))"]}
  gridGap={["scale100", "scale260", "scale420"]}
>
  <Cell>
    <Card variant="border" padding="scale100">
      Best-in-class channel APIs to keep the conversation going across channels
    </Card>
  </Cell>
  <Cell>
    <Card variant="border" padding="scale100">
      Global reach and unrivaled scale that supports over 8 million developers
    </Card>
  </Cell>
</Grid>
```

### Uneven Columns

The Grid prop `gridTemplateColumns` can be used to easily create layouts that span various amounts of columns.

This example also uses the Grid prop `alignItems` to make the content in each cell align to the center of the cell along the y-axis.
The cells with icons also use the prop `justifySelf` to align that cell's content to the center of the cell along the x-axis.

```jsx live
<Grid
  gridTemplateColumns="1fr 6fr"
  gridColumnGap="scale180"
  gridRowGap="scale100"
  alignItems="center"
>
  <Cell justifySelf="center">
    <ChatIcon decorative size="xLarge" />
  </Cell>
  <Cell padding="scale100" backgroundColor="light">
    <Paragraph>
      Twilio provides a simple entry point into the telephony world, and helps
      your business avoid many of the traditional complexities.
    </Paragraph>
  </Cell>
  <Cell justifySelf="center">
    <TerminalIcon decorative size="large" />
  </Cell>
  <Cell padding="scale100" backgroundColor="light">
    <Paragraph>Made for developers by developers</Paragraph>
  </Cell>
</Grid>
```

### Grid Template Areas

The Grid prop `gridTemplateArea` can be combined with Cell components using the `gridArea` prop to easily create custom layouts.

```jsx live
<Grid
  gridTemplateAreas="'a a a a' 'b c c c'"
  gridGap="scale260"
  alignItems="center"
>
  <Cell gridArea="a" justifySelf="center">
    <Heading variant="h2">Programmable SMS</Heading>
  </Cell>
  <Cell gridArea="b">
    <Card padding="scale260">
      <Paragraph marginBottom="scale100">
        Developer Digest, a monthly dose of all things code
      </Paragraph>
      <Button size="small">Subscribe</Button>
    </Card>
  </Cell>
  <Cell gridArea="c" padding="scale100">
    <Paragraph>
      Twilio makes sending and receiving SMS easy. Find the documentation,
      sample code, and developer tools you need to build exactly what you want,
      fast. Let’s get building.
    </Paragraph>
  </Cell>
</Grid>
```

### Alignment

The Grid and Cell components have alignment props which can help align Cells to their desired location along the y-axis. For instance,
`alignSelf` can set a cell to take up the entire height of the largest cell in that row or it can set the cell to align at the top, center, or bottom.

```jsx live
<Grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(4, minmax(0, 1fr))" gridGap="scale100">
  <Cell alignSelf="start" backgroundColor="light" paddingX="scale180">
    start
  </Cell>
  <Cell alignSelf="center" backgroundColor="light" paddingX="scale180">
    center
  </Cell>
  <Cell alignSelf="end" backgroundColor="light" paddingX="scale180">
    end
  </Cell>
  <Cell
    alignSelf="stretch"
    backgroundColor="light"
    paddingX="scale180"
    paddingY="scale260"
  >
    stretch
  </Cell>
</Grid>
```

### Justification

The Grid and Cell components have justification props which can help align Cells to their desired location along the x-axis. For instance,
`justifySelf` can set a cell to take up the entire width of the longest cell in that column or it can be set to align at the left, center, or right of the longest cell.

```jsx live
<Grid gridTemplateColumns="repeat(4, 1fr)" gridGap="scale180">
  <Cell justifySelf="start" backgroundColor="light" padding="scale100">
    start
  </Cell>
  <Cell justifySelf="center" backgroundColor="light" padding="scale100">
    center
  </Cell>
  <Cell justifySelf="end" backgroundColor="light" padding="scale100">
    end
  </Cell>
  <Cell
    justifySelf="stretch"
    backgroundColor="light"
    paddingY="scale100"
    paddingX="scale420"
  >
    stretch
  </Cell>
  <Cell paddingY="scale100" backgroundColor="light" />
  <Cell paddingY="scale100" backgroundColor="light" />
  <Cell paddingY="scale100" backgroundColor="light" />
  <Cell paddingY="scale100" backgroundColor="light" />
</Grid>
```
