## Guidelines

### About Inputs

Inputs are interactive form controls that accept a single line of text from a user. By default, inputs accept any combination of letters number and symbols. They can be given constraints by setting the `type` attribute to one of number, tel, url, or email. Inputs with specific types may also provide customized keyboard layouts in browsers and devices that support dynamic keyboards.

### Accessibility

Here are some quick accessibility tips to ensure a positive user experience for all users.

- Always include a descriptive label for each Input.
- Do not use placeholder text as a replacement for labels.
- Use the most appropriate input type for the data requested (e.g. text, email, or url).
- Use `additional` to provide information on how to pass the Input's validation.
- Use error messages to provide information on how to correct invalid data.

---

## Composition

All Inputs must include a label. A label may be visually hidden only if the purpose of the Input is abundantly apparent. The `hideLabel` prop will remove the label entirely and apply an `aria-label` to the input element for screen readers.

Labels should be short and descriptive with any instructional text belonging in `additional`. Keep supplemental additional text concise and relevant to the input's validation requirements.

When an Input contains invalid data, provide an error message with instructional cues on how to make the correction. Any `additional` text provided with the Input will be replaced by the error. Be sure to repeat any relevant information that would have been lost.

Inputs should only be used on a white background.

<Guidelines>
  <Do>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Only use placeholder text when clarifying examples are required. Try not
        to overuse it as it can cause clutter and confusion for a user.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use help text to provide additional information to the user that could
        help prevent errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use disabled to show a user that an input can not be interacted with
        yet.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Do>
  <DoNot>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't use placeholder text for every field.</li>
      <li>
        Don't use placeholder text to provide error preventing information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't use disabled to show information in an input that can not be
        edited.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </DoNot>
</Guidelines>

## Examples

### Input with Help Text

Labels and help text are controlled via the Input component props in order to ensure consistency and accessibility best practices.

```jsx live
<Formik initialValues={{ email: "" }} onSubmit={() => {}}>
  <Form>
    <Input
      type="email"
      name="email"
      label="Email Address"
      placeholder="(e.g. example@twilio.com)"
      additional="Please enter a valid email."
      required
    />
  </Form>
</Formik>
```

### Input with Error

Inputs come with basic [constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation) enabled by default. You may override the built in validation with the `validate` prop, or completely disable with `noValidate`. For more advanced validation please read the [Formik documentation](https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation). Note that `additional` text is replaced by the validation error.

```jsx live
<Formik
  validateOnMount
  initialTouched={{ email: true }}
  initialValues={{ email: "@twilio.com" }}
  onSubmit={() => {}}
>
  <Form>
    <Input
      type="email"
      name="email"
      label="Email Address"
      additional="Please enter a valid email."
      required
    />
  </Form>
</Formik>
```

### Disabled Input

Disabled form fields cannot be interacted with. Use a read-only field for showing static information which cannot be edited.

```jsx live
<Formik initialValues={{ email: "" }} onSubmit={() => {}}>
  <Form>
    <Input type="email" name="email" label="Email Address" disabled />
  </Form>
</Formik>
```

### Read-only Input

Read-only inputs can be focused but cannot be edited. Use a read-only Input when a user should be able to select and copy the text within. An example of when to use a read-only input may be displaying a user's responses after a form has been submitted.

```jsx live
<Formik initialValues={{ email: "example@twilio.com" }} onSubmit={() => {}}>
  <Form>
    <Input type="email" name="email" label="Email Address" readOnly />
  </Form>
</Formik>
```
