## Guidelines

### About Paragraphs

Paragraphs are blocks of thematically related text typically distinguished from adjacent content with margins.

### Accessibility

Paragraph text should be visually distinct and legible. Text color should always meet AA accessibility standard (4.5:1). Use vertical margins to distinguish sequential Paragraphs.

---

## Composition

Most of the text blocks on a page will use Paragraphs. Paragraphs provide legible defaults for font size, line height and color.

<Guidelines>
  <Do>Keep paragraph line lengths around 50-75 characters.</Do>
  <DoNot>
    Let paragraphs take up the full width of the page or wrap too much.
  </DoNot>
  <Do>
    Use sentence case but add visual hierarchy with color, font weight, and
    size.
  </Do>
  <DoNot>
    Avoid using all caps. Text in all caps is harder to read for all users, but
    especially for some with disabilities.
  </DoNot>
  <Do>
    Focus on what your user really needs to know. Use bullets when listing items
    instead of listing in a paragraph.
  </Do>
  <DoNot>
    Avoid multiple paragraphs of text. UI content should be clear and concise.
  </DoNot>
</Guidelines>

## Examples

### Variants

<!-- cspell:disable -->

```jsx live
<>
  <Paragraph variant="xSmall" marginBottom="scale180">
    ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All
    mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph variant="small" marginBottom="scale180">
    “Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!”
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph variant="medium" marginBottom="scale180">
    He took his vorpal sword in hand; Long time the manxome foe he sought — So
    rested he by the Tumtum tree And stood awhile in thought.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph variant="large" marginBottom="scale180">
    And, as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came
    whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came!
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph variant="xLarge">
    One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went
    snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.
  </Paragraph>
</>
```

### Inverse

```jsx live bg=darkest
<Paragraph color="inversePrimary">
  “And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O
  frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” He chortled in his joy.
</Paragraph>
```
