## Guidelines

### About Selects

Selects are form controls that allow the user to choose from a list of options. Each option can be enabled / disabled, and grouped.

### Accessibility

Here are some quick accessibility tips to ensure a positive user experience for all users.

- Always include a descriptive label for each Select.
- Do not use placeholder text as a replacement for labels.
- Use `additional` to provide information on how to pass the Select's validation.
- Use error messages to provide information on how to correct invalid data.

---

## Composition

All Selects must include a label. A label may be visually hidden only if the purpose of the Select is abundantly apparent. The `hideLabel` prop will remove the label entirely and apply an `aria-label` to the select element for screen readers.

Labels should be short and descriptive with any instructional text belonging in `additional`. Keep supplemental additional text concise and relevant to the select's validation requirements.

When a Select is required and a value is not selected, provide an error message with instructional cues on how to make the correction. Any `additional` text provided with the Select will be replaced by the error. Be sure to repeat any relevant information that would have been lost.

<Guidelines>
  <Do>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use help text to provide additional information to the user that could
        help prevent errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use disabled to show a user that a select can not be interacted with
        yet.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Do>
  <DoNot>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't use placeholder text for every field.</li>
      <li>
        Don't use placeholder text to provide error preventing information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't use disabled to show information in an select that can not be
        edited.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </DoNot>
</Guidelines>

## Examples

### Select with Help Text

Labels and help text are controlled via the Select component props in order to ensure consistency and accessibility best practices.

```jsx live fullWidth
<Formik initialValues={{ yesNo: "" }} onSubmit={() => {}}>
  <Form>
    <Select
      name="yesNo"
      label="Choose an option"
      options={[{ value: "yes", label: "Yes" }]}
      placeholder="Choose one..."
      additional="Please choose one option"
      required
    />
  </Form>
</Formik>
```

### Select with Error

Selects come with basic [constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation) enabled by default. You may override the built in validation with the `validate` prop, or completely disable with `noValidate`. For more advanced validation please read the [Formik documentation](https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation). Note that `additional` text is replaced by the validation error.

```jsx live fullWidth
<Formik
  validateOnMount
  initialTouched={{ yesNo: true }}
  initialValues={{ yesNo: "" }}
  onSubmit={() => {}}
>
  <Form>
    <Select
      name="yesNo"
      label="Choose an option"
      options={[{ value: "yes", label: "Yes" }]}
      placeholder="Choose one..."
      additional="Please choose one option"
      required
    />
  </Form>
</Formik>
```

### Disabled Select

Disabled selects cannot be interacted with. Use a read-only select for showing static information which cannot be edited.

```jsx live fullWidth
<Formik initialValues={{ yesNo: "" }} onSubmit={() => {}}>
  <Form>
    <Select
      name="yesNo"
      label="Choose an option"
      options={[{ value: "yes", label: "Yes" }]}
      disabled
    />
  </Form>
</Formik>
```
