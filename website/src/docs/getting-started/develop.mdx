## 2. Configure GitHub Package Registry

The Match packages are hosted on the GitHub Package Registry and require some additional configuration to install.

### Authentication

Begin by generating a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub with the `read:packages` permission.

For Yarn v2 and up, add the folowing to the `.yarnrc.yml` file in your home folder.

```yaml
npmRegistries:
  "https://npm.pkg.github.com":
    npmAuthToken: REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN
```

For NPM and Yarn v1.x, run the following command. Use your access token when prompted for your password.

```shell
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

### Project Settings

For Yarn 2 and up, add the following to the .yarnrc.yml file in the root of your project:

```yaml
npmScopes:
  twilio-labs:
    npmRegistryServer: "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
```

For Yarn 1, add the following to the .yarnrc file in the root of your project.

```
"@twilio-labs:registry" "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
```

For NPM, add the following to the .npmrc file in the root of your project.

```
@twilio-labs:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## 3. Install Match packages

Install the following package so you can consume Matchâ€™s tokens and themes to build custom page sections.

**Package:** @twilio-labs/match<br />
**Version:** 1.0.0-alpha.4

```bash
npm install --save @twilio-labs/match
```
